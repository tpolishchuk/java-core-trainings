Task 1: Console loggers

In this task you will not get exact instructions how to build your entities. Feel free to design your task using all of
knowledge you've gained in previous 7 workshops

1. For current task you need to learn how to color console output:

2. Create class Console. It will contain main method, where you will check your entities

The main purpose of the task is to create 3 different loggers: error logger, info logger and debug logger.
Each logger will print logs in accordance with its style. Feel free to set any style you want

3. Create enum LogType with following data: ERROR, INFO and DEBUG

4. Create class LoggerStyle. It should contain textColor, backgroundColor and reset color constant
Define which fields need getters and setters. Think about access modifiers

5. Create class DateTimeHelper. Is should contain only one method which returns current time in defined format.
Remember Task#5 from Workshop#3

6. Create class Logger. It should contain such fields as:
 - LoggerStyle loggerStyle;
 - LogType logType;
 - String simpleDateFormat;
and method print(), which will print your message in defined style. Choose any format you want. For example:
[Hours:Minutes:Seconds] LogType: Message
Think about managing the situations if loggerStyle, logType or simpleDate format are not set

7. Create classes for debug logger, info logger and error logger inherited from Logger. Define necessary constructors and
fields. Think whether any of this information should be shown to end user. Override methods if necessary

8. Use your loggers in Console.
