Task 1: Random values generators

1. In your package for workshop 7 create a class named RandomValuesGenerator
RandomValuesGenerator should contain the following data:
- constructor, which prints to console "RandomValuesGenerator was created". Avoid hardcoding of 'RandomValuesGenerator'
in yor message, better get class name as it it shown in lecture 51
- protected void method generateRandomStuff(), which takes int objectsAmount as an argument. This method should produce the message:
'Unable to create %d unknown arguments', where %d will be replaced with objectsAmount value

2. In your package for workshop 7 create a class named Cat
Cat should contain the following data:
- String field name;
- int field age;
- constructor, which takes name and age as arguments
- Overridden public String toString(), which returns Cat as String. E.g.
Cat{name='%s', age='%d'}

3. In your package for workshop 7 create a class named RandomIntegersGenerator, which extends RandomValuesGenerator
RandomIntegersGenerator should contain its own implementation of generateRandomStuff() method and print
to console random Integers. Amount of Integers is defined by objectsAmount argument.

4. In your package for workshop 7 create a class named RandomStringsGenerator, which extends RandomValuesGenerator
RandomStringsGenerator should contain its own implementation of generateRandomStuff() method and print
to console random Strings. Amount of Strings is defined by objectsAmount argument.

5. In your package for workshop 7 create a class named RandomCatsGenerator, which extends RandomValuesGenerator
RandomCatsGenerator should contain its own implementation of generateRandomStuff() method and print
to console random Cats. Amount of Cats is defined by objectsAmount argument.

6. In your package for workshop 7 create a class named RandomHamstersGenerator, which extends RandomValuesGenerator

7. In your package for workshop 7 create a class named Executor
Executor should contain main method, which contains the following objects

- RandomIntegersGenerator
- RandomStringsGenerator
- RandomCatsGenerator
- RandomHamstersGenerator

and all of the objects should call generateRandomStuff() method.

Example:

public static void main(String[] args) {
        RandomIntegersGenerator randomIntegersGenerator = new RandomIntegersGenerator();
        randomIntegersGenerator.generateRandomStuff(5);

        RandomStringsGenerator randomStringsGenerator = new RandomStringsGenerator();
        randomStringsGenerator.generateRandomStuff(5);

        RandomCatsGenerator randomCatsGenerator = new RandomCatsGenerator();
        randomCatsGenerator.generateRandomStuff(2);

        RandomHamsterGenerator randomHamsterGenerator = new RandomHamsterGenerator();
        randomHamsterGenerator.generateRandomStuff(1);
}

Console output:

RandomIntegersGenerator was created
