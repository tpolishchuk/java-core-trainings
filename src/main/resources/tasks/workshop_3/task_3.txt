Before start:
1. Get acquainted with example in java-core-trainings/src/main/java/examples/RandomUtilsExample.java
2. Get acquainted with documentation given in useful_links.txt

In this task we will write a mini-simulator of lottery.
Define as a positive int constant your 'lucky number'.
Write a method, which generates integer numbers during defined amount of seconds and detects,
whether random integer number equals your 'lucky number'. You also should define a range of integers for generation.
If generated number equals 'lucky number', write to console:
"You won with number " + luckyNumber
If during defined amount of seconds your 'lucky number' was not equal to any generated number, write to console:
"Your game was not successful, try again"
If range for generated integers is set as negative value, write to console:
"Cannot generate integers from 0 to your value. Please, define positive integer maximum value for generator"

Example:

public class LotterySimulator {

    private static final int luckyNumber = 10;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        playLottery(1, 5);
        playLottery(100, 600);
        playLottery(-1, 600);
    }

    private void playLottery(int maximumIntForRandomGenerator, int durationInSeconds){
    ... your implementation here ...
    }
}

Expected console output:
Your game was not successful, try again
You won with number 10
Cannot generate integers from 0 to your value. Please, define positive integer maximum value for generator
