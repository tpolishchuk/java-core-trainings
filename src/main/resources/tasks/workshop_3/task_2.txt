Write a method, which determines the longest word in given sentence.
If the sentence has two longest words with the same length, just print the last one.
Do not calculate whitespaces, apostrophes, commas, dashes and dots as a word.

Example:

private void printTheLongestWord(String sentence){
... your implementation here ...
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  printTheLongestWord("Buy yellow banana!");
  printTheLongestWord("");
  printTheLongestWord("I don't need a hair stylist, my pillow gives me a new hairstyle every morning.");
  printTheLongestWord("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog");
  printTheLongestWord("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.");
}

Expected console output:

In the sentence:
"Buy yellow banana!"
The longest word is "banana"

In the sentence:
""
The longest cannot be calculated, because there is no sentence

In the sentence:
"I don't need a hair stylist, my pillow gives me a new hairstyle every morning."
The longest word is "hairstyle"

...
