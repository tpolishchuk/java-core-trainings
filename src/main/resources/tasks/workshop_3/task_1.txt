Imagine that you have a login form with 3 buttons:
- "Sign in via email", which redirects to user's account page
- "Sign in via Facebook", which redirects to facebook.com to grab FB session
- "Sign in via Google Plus", which redirects to google.com to grab Google session

You need to create a method, which uses switch statement, takes button name as argument and tells user where he will be
redirected.

Example:

private void analyzeRedirect(String buttonName){
... your implementation here ...
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
  analyzeRedirect("Sign in via email");
  analyzeRedirect("Sign in via Facebook");
  analyzeRedirect("Sign in via Google Plus");
  analyzeRedirect("Lorem Ipsum");
}

Expected console output:

You have pressed "Sign in via email". Wait for redirection to your account page
You have pressed "Sign in via Facebook". Wait for redirection to Facebook
You have pressed "Sign in via Google Plus". Wait for redirection to Google
You have pressed unknown element and system error occurred. Please, contact site administrator
