Task 1: Basic class creation

Before start:
1. Watch lectures 41-44 and perform challenges.
2. Read materials and perform examples from tasks/workshop_5/useful_links.txt

Task:
1. In your package for workshop#5 create a class named BasePage

It is a very basic representation of web page object. Imagine, that you are describing one of webpages
Access modifiers are intentionally not defined here. Think about their implementation, do not use 'public' everywhere.
Remember, that you should hide as much as possible: some of methods should be visible only inside class, some of them -
for child classes and only a very small part - for external classes.

It should contain:
1. String constant BASE_URL = "http://www.buycarshere.com". It is the basic url of all our next pages
2. String field partialURL. It is part of URL that could be changed. For example, /faq will be partial URL for
http://www.buycarshere.com/faq page
3. Constructor, which takes partialUrl as argument and sets partialUrl into class
4. void method showHeader(). This method should print to console "Page header is shown"
5. void method showFooter(). This method should print to console "Page footer is shown"
6. void method showBody(). This method should print to console "Page body is shown"
7. void method openPage(). This method should:
- inform user about the URL he is visiting
- show header
- show body
- show footer
