Task 3: Catalog page creation

Before start:
1. Perform Task#2 or at least Task#1

Task:
1. In your package for workshop#5 create a class named CatalogPage
Access modifiers are intentionally not defined here as well as in Task #1 and Task#2
It should contain:
1. Inheritance from BasePage
2. Implementation, which allows to open page with the following information
- full URL user is visiting
- return from method if partialUrl is not equal /cars, /motorcycles, /commercial-vehicles or /all with appropriate error
  message to user
- message, that page header is shown
- message, that cars catalog is shown if user visits /cars page OR
  message, that motorcycles catalog is shown if user visits /motorcycles page OR
  message, that commercial vehicles catalog is shown if user visits /commercial-vehicles page OR
  message, that all vehicles catalog is shown if user visits /all page
- message, that page footer is shown

2. In your package for workshop#5 create a class named Browser, if it doesn't exist
It should contain:
1. public static void main() method, as usual, where we will 'observe' pages
2. Put the following code into your main class and execute it:
public static void main(String[] args) {
        CatalogPage catalogPage = new CatalogPage("/cars");
        catalogPage.openPage();
        catalogPage = new CatalogPage("/motorcycles");
        catalogPage.openPage();
        catalogPage = new CatalogPage("/commercial-vehicles");
        catalogPage.openPage();
        catalogPage = new CatalogPage("/all");
        catalogPage.openPage();
        catalogPage = new CatalogPage("/sellcar");
        catalogPage.openPage();
}

you should see something like that in your console:

Opening URL http://www.buycarshere.com/cars
Page header is shown
Cars catalog is shown
Page footer is shown

Opening URL http://www.buycarshere.com/motorcycles
Page header is shown
