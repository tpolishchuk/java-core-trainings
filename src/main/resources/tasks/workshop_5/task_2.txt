Before start:
1. Perform Task#1

Task:
1. In your package for workshop#5 create a class named LoginPage
Access modifiers are intentionally not defined here as well as in Task #1
It should contain:
1. Inheritance from BasePage
2. Implementation, which allows to open page with the following information
- full URL user is visiting
- message, that page header is shown
- message, that login form is shown
- message, that page footer is shown

2. In your package for workshop#5 create a class named Browser
It should contain:
1. public static void main() method, as usual, where we will 'observe' pages

2. Put the following code into your main class and execute it:
public static void main(String[] args) {
        LoginPage loginPage = new LoginPage("/login");
        loginPage.openPage();
}

you should see something like that in your console:

Opening URL http://www.buycarshere.com/login
