Task#1

- Create an interface FuelConsuming with method calculateFuelConsumption(int kilometers);
- Create the following classes:
    - Car
    - Motorcycle
    - Truck
    - Aircraft
    And implement FuelConsuming interface for them. Method calculateFuelConsumption() should return an amount of consumed fuel
    in liters for required distance (take abstract average number for every vehicle type);
- Create a class Calculator with main method, which contains:
    - one Car object
    - one Motorcycle object
    - one Truck object
    - one Aircraft object
    - calculation of consumed fuel for every vehicle type printed out to console. E.g.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car someCar = new Car();
        System.out.println(someCar.calculateFuelConsumption(200));
    }
