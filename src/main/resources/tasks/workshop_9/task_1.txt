Task#1: Numbers game

In scope of this task you will write simple console text game with the following rules:
Players amount: 2. You and bot
Common concept:
You are playing with bot N rounds. Each round:
- You choose random number from 0 to 20. Bot generates random number from 0 to 20
- You choose number first, only then bot generates its number
- If you type number more than maximum number in range, you fail this round automatically, bot wins
- If your numbers are equal, nobody wins
- If the difference between your numbers is more than 5, nobody wins
- If bot has chosen a number, which is more than your and difference between your numbers is 5 or less, bot wins
- If you have chosen a number, which is more than bot's number and difference between your numbers is 5 or less,
you win

Write your own implementation of this game using materials we've already learned.
Example of game log is attached in workshop_9/task_1_output_example.txt

As a tip, here is structure draft of classes I've used for implementation. Feel free to use your own:

1. Player.java:
   - field: String name
   - field: boolean[] scoreTable; If player won round - put here true as array member, if lost - put false
   - constructor: Player(String name);
   - method: String getName();
   - method: void initScoreTable(int roundsAmount);
   - method: void fillInScoreTable(int roundNumber, boolean isWinner);
   - method: int getWinsAmountFromScoreTable();

2. Bot.java:
   - extends Player.java;
   - constructor: Bot(String name);
   - method: int typeRandomInt(int range);

3. RealPerson.java:
   - extends Player.java;
   - constructor: RealPerson(String name);
   - field: Scanner scanner;
   - method: int typeRandomInt();

4. Game.java:
   - method: public static void main(String[] args);
   - private static final int ROUNDS_AMOUNT = 5; You can change it as you wish
   - private static final int RANGE = 20; Range of numbers generation from 0 to 20. You can change it as you wish
   - method: void playGame(RealPerson person, Bot bot, int rounds, int range);
   - method: void playRound(RealPerson person, Bot bot, int roundNumber, int range);
   - method: void defineWinner(RealPerson person, Bot bot);

   Main method example:

   public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bot bot = new Bot("Bobby");
        RealPerson person = new RealPerson("John");

        bot.initScoreTable(ROUNDS_AMOUNT);
        person.initScoreTable(ROUNDS_AMOUNT);

        playGame(person, bot, ROUNDS_AMOUNT, RANGE);
        defineWinner(person, bot);
   }
