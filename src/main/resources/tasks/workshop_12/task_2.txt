Task#2

1. Create a class Satellite, which has
 - String field name;
 - inner class Coordinates;
 - method start();
 - method getCoordinates();

 Class Coordinates should have two Double fields:
  - elevation;
  - azimuth;

2. Create a class FlightCenter, which contains main() method

3. Write code, which:
 - creates a Satellite object;
 - writes "Launching %name%", when method start() is called;
 - writes a Satellite coordinates to console every 1 second until user presser R button on keyboard;
 - writes "Preparing to return %name% to Earth" after button R is pressed and exits;

Think about codestyle and ways to optimize your code as much as possible. Probably, you need to write some additional
methods and provide additional variables
