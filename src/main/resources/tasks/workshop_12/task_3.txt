Task3#

Before you start this task, refresh your memory with some theory:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifconfig

1. Create a class NetworkConfiguration, which contains:
 - field List<NetworkInterfaceConfiguration> networkInterfacesConfiguration;

 Class NetworkInterfaceConfiguration should contain the following fields
  - String name;
  - String ipv4;

2. Create a class Executor, which detects your network interfaces with ipv4 and prints them to console.
Try to search for libraries, which can help you to get necessary network data. As an option, you can use
the following classes:

java.net.InetAddress;
java.net.NetworkInterface;
java.net.SocketException;
java.util.Enumeration;

Example:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NetworkInterfaceConfiguration networkInterfaceConfiguration = new NetworkInterfaceConfiguration();
        networkInterfaceConfiguration.showInterfacesWithIPv4();
   }

   Console output:

   en0 : 192.168.2.104
   lo0 : 127.0.0.1

Think about codestyle and ways to optimize your code as much as possible. Probably, you need to write some additional
methods and provide additional variables
