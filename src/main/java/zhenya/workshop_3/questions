project settings in intro - why he does it?

- Java 8 has some new features, which will not be compiled, if your Idea sets Java 7 for default compilation.
Course overviews Java 8, so it's necessary to set SDK 1.8 to avoid problems with tasks compilation

when I use switch? two "if" arleady a sign?

- Switch is more readable and it's more easy to debug switch than several if's

can I use condition in switch? ex. D>0

- No, for conditions use if-else

main at the end or at the beginning of the code?

- Better at the beginning, but it's just a recommendation

how to define string and do I need to do it, ex. String longestWord = "";

- Usually you don't need to define empty string. Nevertheless, if it's necessary, there are 2 options:
String longestWord = "";
String longestWord = StringUtils.EMPTY;

private  void extractDigitsFromText(String text){ - I have to add static
- You need to call always only static methods from another static methods.
Currently our task methods do some helper actions and do not represent features of TaskX.class.
Later we will learn basics of classes and start to use non-static methods
There is a good bunch of recommendations when to use static methods:
