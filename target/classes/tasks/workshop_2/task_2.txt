Firstly, read about quadratic equations and quadratic formula from section "Useful data"

Calculate x values by common quadratic formula. Set a, b, c as arguments in your calculation method

For example:

private double calculateXByQuadraticFormula(int a, int b, int c){
... your implementation here ...
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
   calculateXByQuadraticFormula(1, 8, -5);
   calculateXByQuadraticFormula(-8, 10, 14);
   ... etc.
}

Expected console output:

Calculating x by quadratic formula
a = 1
b = 8
c = -5
x1 = 0.58
x2 = -8.58

Calculating x by quadratic formula
a = -8
b = 10
c = 14
x1 = -0.84
x2 = 2.09

... etc.
