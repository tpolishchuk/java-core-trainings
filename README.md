How to handle this project?
===========================

Workshop tasks
==============

All homework for each workshop is places to appropriate [resources](https://github.com/tpolishchuk/java-core-trainings/tree/master/src/main/resources/tasks) folder of this workshop

Examples:
* [Tasks for Workshop #1](https://github.com/tpolishchuk/java-core-trainings/tree/master/src/main/resources/tasks/workshop_1)
* [Tasks for Workshop #2](https://github.com/tpolishchuk/java-core-trainings/tree/master/src/main/resources/tasks/workshop_2)

Homework is designed for doing during 1-2 hours weekly

Project packages
================

Each participant has its own package with subdirectories for each workshop 
![Folders structure](src/main/resources/readme/project_packages.png?raw=true "Folders structure")

It is better to create one executable instance per task

In this case you can run your code as it shown on a screenshot:

![Running code](src/main/resources/readme/running_code.png?raw=true "Running code")

Or debug your code:

![Debugging code](src/main/resources/readme/debugging_code.png?raw=true "Debugging code")

Review duties
=============

Each participant will act as reviewer and should be reviewed each workshop.

You can find file review_duty.txt in your own package for each workshop.

Review duties will be mixed each workshop and review_duty.txt will be added for each participant.

Do not hesitate to exchange information with each other, review and discuss task solutions.

Have fun :)
